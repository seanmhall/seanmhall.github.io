This is my attempt at creating a way to play Countdown on the web. I've never made a game before so I thought this would be a fun project. I'm sure this is something that's been done many times before but I deliberately avoided looking at any existing ones before making this.

*** LETTERS ROUND ***
The scoring for the Letters round goes by the Honor System for words of 6 letters or less. Words 7-9 letters are checked against a list of words that came from here: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
If you type a letter that isn't one of the 9 selected letters for that round, or use a selected letter more times than it appears the Letter Counter next to the input box will turn red. Any invalid input will automatically score 0 points.

*** NUMBERS ROUND ***
The scoring for the Numbers Round for the time being is entirely on the Honor System. There is also no way to check for possible solutions, for now. I'm sure somebody has written an algorithm to solve these already but I would like to do it myself. This feature will maybe appear in a future release.

*** CONUNDRUM ***
The letter counter next to the input box will light up red if you have invalid input. The number turning green indicates a *possible* correct answer (spefically, the letters you provided are all the same as the letters in the clue, but the order could still be wrong).
